This is an end to end project on predicting the calories burnt using Machine Learning (Multiple Regression)
Regression analysis is a statistical method used to examine the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (predictors). It helps in predicting outcomes, identifying trends, and understanding the impact of different factors on a variable.

Key Aspects of Regression Analysis:
Types of Regression Models:

Linear Regression – Models the relationship using a straight line (Y = β₀ + β₁X + ε).
Multiple Regression – Involves multiple independent variables.
Logistic Regression – Used for binary classification problems.
Polynomial Regression – Fits a nonlinear relationship using polynomial functions.
Ridge & Lasso Regression – Handle multicollinearity and improve model generalization.
Applications:

Finance: Predicting stock prices and portfolio performance.
Marketing: Estimating customer demand based on ad spending.
Healthcare: Analyzing disease risk factors.
Operations: Forecasting sales and optimizing supply chain management.
Key Metrics:

R² (Coefficient of Determination): Measures model accuracy.
Adjusted R²: Adjusts for the number of predictors.
P-values: Determine the significance of independent variables.
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): Evaluates prediction error.
Assumptions (For Linear Regression):

Linearity between variables.
No multicollinearity among independent variables.
Homoscedasticity (constant variance of residuals).
Normal distribution of residuals.
Implementation in Business Analytics:

Used in predictive modeling to drive data-driven decisions.
Helps in risk management and cost optimization strategies.
Powers customer segmentation and churn prediction models in business.
